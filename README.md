# Fly-in — Drone Routing Simulation

## Description

Fly-in is a drone routing simulation system written in Python 3.10+. The goal is to route a fleet of drones from a start zone to a target end zone through a network of connected zones, minimizing the total number of simulation turns while respecting strict movement and capacity constraints.

The system parses a custom map file format, builds a graph of zones and connections, computes optimal paths using a weighted Dijkstra algorithm with iterative penalty-based diversification, and simulates the turn-by-turn movement of all drones simultaneously. It produces a step-by-step log of drone movements and provides colored terminal output, a static graph visualization (matplotlib), and an interactive step-by-step animation (pygame).

## Instructions

### Requirements

```bash
make install
```

Creates a virtual environment in `.venv/` and installs all dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

### Running the simulation

```bash
# Static mode: run simulation then display graph (matplotlib)
make run

# Static mode with a specific map
make run MAP=maps/easy/01_linear_path.txt

# Animation mode: interactive step-by-step visualization (pygame)
make animate

# Animation mode with a specific map
make animate MAP=maps/hard/01_maze_nightmare.txt
```

### Other commands

```bash
make debug          # Run in debug mode with pdb
make lint           # Run flake8 + mypy with mandatory flags
make lint-strict    # Run flake8 + mypy with --strict
make clean          # Remove __pycache__, .mypy_cache, .pytest_cache, *.pyc, *.pyo
make fclean         # clean + remove the virtual environment

```

### Map file format

```
nb_drones: 5
start_hub: hub 0 0 [color=green]
end_hub: goal 10 10 [color=yellow]
hub: roof1 3 4 [zone=restricted color=red]
hub: corridorA 4 3 [zone=priority color=green max_drones=2]
hub: obstacleX 5 5 [zone=blocked color=gray]
connection: hub-roof1
connection: hub-corridorA
connection: corridorA-goal [max_link_capacity=2]
```

Zone types:
 
- `normal` — standard zone, 1 turn to enter (default)
- `restricted` — sensitive zone, 2 turns to enter (drone occupies the connection during the first turn and must arrive on the second)
- `priority` — preferred zone, 1 turn to enter, same 1 turn cost as normal zones but preferred by the pathfinder when two routes tie
- `blocked` — inaccessible, drones cannot enter or pass through

### Example input and expected output

**Map file** (`maps/easy/01_linear_path.txt`):
```
nb_drones: 2
start_hub: start 0 0 [color=green]
end_hub: goal 3 0 [color=yellow]
hub: mid1 1 0
hub: mid2 2 0
connection: start-mid1
connection: mid1-mid2
connection: mid2-goal
```

**Expected output**:
```
D1-mid1
D1-mid2 D2-mid1
D1-goal D2-mid2
D2-goal

Simulation complete!
  Total turns  : 4
  Drones delivered: 2
```

Each line is one simulation turn. `D<ID>-<zone>` means drone D\<ID\> moved to that zone. Drones that do not move in a given turn are omitted. When a drone moves toward a `restricted` zone, the format is `D<ID>-<zoneA>-<zoneB>` for the first turn (in transit) and `D<ID>-<zoneB>` for the arrival turn.

## Algorithm Explanation

### Pathfinding — Dijkstra with iterative penalty diversification

Implemented from scratch in `src/pathfinding.py`. No graph libraries are used.

**Core algorithm:** Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest weighted path from the start zone to the end zone. Each zone has a movement weight based on its type: `normal` and `priority` zones both cost 1.0, `restricted` zones 2.0, and `blocked` zones are excluded entirely from the search. When two routes reach a neighbor with equal cost, `priority` zones are always preferred over `normal` zones via an explicit tiebreaker in node selection and path recording.

**Path diversification:** To distribute drones across multiple routes and avoid bottlenecks, the algorithm is run iteratively up to `max_paths` times. After each path is found, a penalty of 1.5 is added to every intermediate zone on that path. This causes the next Dijkstra run to explore alternative routes. Up to 4 diverse paths are computed (2 for maps with 25+ drones to reduce initialization time), and drones are assigned to these paths in round-robin order.

**Complexity:** Each Dijkstra run is O(V²) using a list-based min selection (V = number of zones). The penalty loop runs up to `max_paths` times, so total pathfinding cost is O(max_paths × V²). For the maps in this project this is negligible.

### Simulation — Turn-by-turn synchronous scheduling

Implemented in `src/simulation.py`. Each call to `_run_turn` processes all drones simultaneously in a single pass:

1. **Transit arrivals first:** Drones that entered a `restricted` zone on the previous turn (marked `in_transit=True`) arrive at their destination. Arrival respects `max_drones` capacity of the destination zone.
2. **Candidate selection:** All non-delivered, non-transiting drones with a valid next step are collected as candidates.
3. **Move validation:** For each candidate, `_can_move` checks:
   - The connection between the current and next zone exists.
   - The connection's `max_link_capacity` is not already saturated for this turn.
   - The destination zone's `max_drones` will not be exceeded (accounting for drones already leaving that zone and drones already entering it this turn, plus any future in-transit arrivals for restricted zones).
   - Start and end zones are always accepted regardless of occupancy.
4. **Movement execution:** Drones moving to a `restricted` zone are placed `in_transit` and logged as `D<ID>-<origin>-<dest>`. All others move immediately.

**Deadlock detection:** If no drone moves for 20 consecutive turns, a `SimulationDeadlockError` is raised and caught in `main.py` with a clean error message and exit code 1.

**Path caching:** Paths are computed once at initialization and stored per drone. There is no per-turn recalculation. If a drone is blocked it simply waits in place; its stored path remains unchanged.

### Performance results

|---|---|---|---|
| Easy 1 — Linear path | 2 | 4 turns | ≤ 6 |
| Easy 2 — Simple fork | 4 | 4 turns | ≤ 8 |
| Easy 3 — Basic capacity | 4 | 4 turns | ≤ 6 |
| Medium 1 — Dead end trap | 5 | 8 turns | ≤ 12 |
| Medium 2 — Circular loop | 6 | 15 turns | ≤ 15 |
| Medium 3 — Priority puzzle | 5 | 7 turns | ≤ 12 |
| Hard 1 — Maze nightmare | 8 | 13 turns | ≤ 30 |
| Hard 2 — Capacity hell | 12 | 16 turns | ≤ 35 |

| Challenger — The Impossible Dream | 25 | **44 turns** | ≤ 45 (record) |

All targets met or beaten. The challenger map beats the reference record of 45 turns.

## Visual Representation

### Terminal output — colorama (`make run` / `make animate`)

Every simulation turn is printed to the terminal with colored output. Drone identifiers (`D1`, `D2`, …) are highlighted in yellow. Zone names are colored using the color defined in the map file (e.g. `color=red` renders in red). This makes it easy to follow drone movements and spot zone types at a glance without opening the graphical window.

Supported terminal colors: `green`, `blue`, `red`, `yellow`, `gray`, `orange`, `purple`, `cyan`, `white`, `black`, `brown`, `lime`, `magenta`, `gold`, `pink`, `teal`, `maroon`, `darkred`, `violet`, `crimson`.

### Static graph — matplotlib (`make run`)

After the simulation completes, a graph of the zone network is rendered using matplotlib:

- Each zone is drawn as a colored circle using the color from the map file.
- Zone names are printed inside the circle. Zones with `max_drones > 1` show a `max:N` label below.
- Connections are drawn as gray lines. Connections with `max_link_capacity > 1` show a `cap:N` label.
- A color legend in the top-right corner maps each color to its zone type.

This view is useful for understanding the map topology before or after running the simulation.

### Interactive animation — pygame (`make animate`)

An interactive window opens showing the drone routing network with live drone positions:

- **SPACE** — advance one turn and update drone positions on the graph.
- **Q** — close the window.

Drones are shown as orange circles with their ID label, positioned on top of their current zone. When a drone is in transit toward a restricted zone, it is rendered at the midpoint of the connection. Multiple drones on the same zone are spread out in a grid so they remain individually visible. Connection capacities and zone capacities are displayed as labels. A dynamic legend in the least-crowded corner shows zone colors and their types.

This mode is the most useful for understanding how the algorithm distributes drones and handles contention at bottleneck zones.
